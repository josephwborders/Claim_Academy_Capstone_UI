                                                        A concrete example of a goal I achieved would be earning a bachelor's degree at the
                                                        age of 32. How did I get through the course load while working and being a husband?
                                                        Refer to the millionaire guide above. I break challenges down into manageable pieces
                                                        and iterate until the job is done.

                                                            I felt courses were oriented toward recent high-school graduates. My maturity and real
                                                            world experience gave me the tools and perspective needed to complete assignments on-time

                                                    becoming a millionaire, sometimes an underlying question needs answering; "What do I want
                                                    a million dollars for anyway?"
                                                    <p>
                                                        I currently have 12/36 semester hours required toward an MBA in Finance. By "currently",
                                                        I mean that my count hasn't changed in the last 5 years.
                                                        <p>
                                                            The only thing that had changed, academically, between the Bachelor's and Master's levels
                                                            was that the assignments were taking 3x longer to complete; much more reading and longer
                                                            research papers. The subject matter was the same. I was missing out on valueable time with
                                                            friends and family in pursuit of a degree which my job did not require, nor were there any
                                                            new employment opportunities on the horizon after completion.

                                                                I turned introspective and asked myself why I wanted the MBA. The simple answer was that I
                                                                wanted to be able to say I had an MBA in Finance. I had done a lot of work with management
                                                                consultants, and had generally been impressed by people who'd earned MBAs. I knew how I viewed
                                                                MBA graduates, and wanted to be viewed in the same light.
                                                                <p>
                                                                    After figuring out that I was neglecting family and friends in pursuit of essentially vanity,
                                                                    I decided to put the MBA on the back burner and go back to enjoying life. I have no regrets
                                                                    about the decision.

                                                    In my recent experience as a Project Manager with NATO as my customer, time management,
                                                    personal boundaries, and delegation were essential.

                                                    I cannot be in two places at once, and cannot teleport instantly to the scene of every
                                                    emergency. This is where trusting my team and being able to delegate were invaluable. My
                                                    team were aware of my intent for the project and given the freedom to figure out the
                                                    details of how to execute on their own. Communication with the team is key.

                                                    Time management kept me sane. To-do lists are never-ending. I had a policy of using the first
                                                    half of my day clearing my plate, then leaving the second half open for whatever might've come
                                                    up at the last minute. My team knew that if they needed something after the first half of the
                                                    day, and their need was not urgent, to email me and their item would be at the top of my list
                                                    for the following morning. Everyone respected this system and it was never a problem.

                                                    Setting boundaries: A PM's phone never ceases to ring, be it the customer, framework nation,
                                                    other contractors, team leaders, etc. Staff knew not to call me about small things without
                                                    going through their team leaders first, and that an email is always welcome. Even the customer
                                                    started to buy into my logic that meeting in the early morning is superior to meeting at 3 in
                                                    the afternoon when the the temperature is 1,000 degrees and everyone is grumpy.

                                                    The key to handling mistakes is to do whatever it takes to put it in the past as
                                                    quickly as possible. In my experience this means taking responsibility, accepting
                                                    whatever comes next (be it a firm talking-to, or formal action), learning from the
                                                    mistake, and moving forward.

                                                    What's unacceptable to me, whether as a team member or team leader, is wasting time
                                                    pointing fingers and shifting blame. Wasting time adds to the negative impact of whatever
                                                    the mistake may have entailed. The easy way is always for the responsible party to own up,
                                                    take their licks, and move on.

                                                    With years of experience comes the intuition to know when to let sleeping dogs lie.
                                                    This applies equally to professional life and interpersonal relationships.

                                                    Sometimes a problem will sort itself out on it's own without any intervention. My time
                                                    and energy are limited, and I cannot be everywhere at once. Not everything needs immediate
                                                    attention. Carefully choosing which items to prioritize ensures that the big picture goals
                                                    are achieved, while leaving room for smaller items to work themselves out in the meantime.
                                                    If the smaller items end up not working themselves out, I'll have the time and attention
                                                    required to resolve them since I'll have handled my main priorities first.

                                                    may include breed, weight, hair color, and eye color. A behavior or a method of the dog
                                                    class might be to bark or wag the tail. A dog object created from this class will have

                                                    Inheritance: Child class inherits attributes and methods from parent class. Example
                                                    Lamborghini inherits attributes from class vehicle. Method drive might be 200mph
                                                    for a Lamborghini, but 45mph if a dump truck inherits and uses the drive method from
                                                    the vehicle class. Parent is also called a super.

                                                    Polymorphism: Means many forms, the same entity (object, method, or operator) can
                                                    perform different operations in different scenarios. Example, the + operator can be
                                                    used to add numbers or concatenate strings. The print() method can be used to print
                                                    integers, characters, strings, memory locations, etc.

                                                    Abstraction: Abstraction is the concealment of unnecessary details and exposing only
                                                    the required characteristics of an object. Example, a phone user wants to dial a number
                                                    and make a call. He uses the keypad and display interfaces, but doesn’t need to see
                                                    that the device is negotiating a connection with the nearest cell tower, using a common
                                                    communication protocol, regulating transmission power to the antenna, etc.Abstraction
                                                    is achieved via abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes and methods are
                                                    accessible via interface. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods without
                                                    a body, example is a repository), or non-abstract methods.

                                                    Encapsulation: Data hiding. We create attributes of an object within a class and use the
                                                    private access modifier. We instantiate the object and use getters and setters to set the
                                                    attributes of the object using “this” keyword which serves as a pointer to the private
                                                    attributes of the object class. By omitting either getters or setters, we can make
                                                    attributes read-only or write-only.

                                                    Overriding: a Lamborghini might inherit a drive method a super class "vehicle"
                                                    and use it to drive 300mph and pull 6Gs in the corners while a schoolbus might
                                                    use the same method to behave differently.

                                                <p>
                                                    We can create methods of the same name if they accept different parameters as arguments.
                                                    Example calculate method accepts int a and int b, multiplies them together and returns
                                                    the result. The same method could be used to calculate the area of a rectangle or triangle
                                                    if used in a certain way.

                                                    Arrays are fixed in size and useful when you know how many elements you need to store.
                                                    Example a classroom with 20 seats would need an array with space for 20 student objects.
                                                    The downside is arrays are immutable, so a new one must be created if the size needs
