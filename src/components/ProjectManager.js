                        <strong>Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance</strong> (ISR) Project Manager overall
                        responsible for ensuring the availability of ISR assets across two NATO camps
                        within the Kabul Base Cluster. The system itself consisted of approximately
                        200 networked long-range, day, night, and thermal cameras, servers, routers,
                        switches, uninterruptible power supplies, and all transmission media (fiber,
                        copper, coaxial cable).

                    <li>
                        <strong>Managed a team of 6 engineers and 12 CCTV operators.</strong> Cameras were actively 
                        monitored by my team for threats to base security and the safety of the troops
                        and civilians within the perimeter. Cameras were networked into their respective
                        base operations centers, as well as alternate back-up operations center sites.
                        My streams and equipment were also available to any authorized user within the
                        Kabul Base Cluster who may have needed visibility in my parts of the city in 
                        support of their own missions.

                        In addition to the ISR assets mentioned above, perimeter security equipment also 
                        fell within the scope of my project. <strong>Electronic fence line monitoring sensors</strong>
                        were installed and maintained by my engineers, networked into the operations 
                        centers, and monitored by my operations staff.

                        <strong>Project assets included over $30M in equipment and spares</strong> inventories, and a 
                        monthly maintenance budget in excess of $30,000 per month. As Project Project 
                        Manager I was responsible for all deliverables required by the Statement of Work
                        (SOW) including timely completion of over 100 reports per month, responding to 
                        RFPs, adding new capabilities when required by the customer, interviewing 
                        candidates, submitting prospective employees for customer approval, visa 
                        and travel authorization approvals, leave rotation planning, and monthly
                        staff rostering.

                        frequency jamming equipment in vehicle and fixed site configurations. RF jammers
                        flood the electromagnetic spectrum with noise preventing the transmission and 
                        reception of signals used by enemy forces to detonate improvised explosive 
                        devices, while allowing coalition troops to comminicate via issued radio 
                        equipment.

                        Used <strong>spectrum analyzers</strong> to perform site surveys for fixed installations in order 
                        to <strong>write threat loads / instructions</strong> for the equipment to execute in specific 
                        locations depending on which signals are the most active in the area (which frequencies
                        to jam and for how many milliseconds per cycle).

                        This was an <strong>extra duty</strong> I undertook due to manning shortages and movement restrictions
                        during the COVID-19 pandemic. No other engineers were customer-approved for the task,
                        so <strong>I stepped in and covered this function in addition to my duties as ISR Project 
                        Manager.</strong>
